This HR analytics project focuses on predicting employee attrition using the IBM HR Employee Attrition dataset. The project aims to understand why employees leave, identify patterns, and build a predictive model to help HR teams improve retention.



Key aspects of the project include:


Data Analysis and Visualization: The project involved cleaning and organizing data, and creating visualizations using Power BI, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to identify patterns and trends.




Attrition by Department: The Sales department showed the highest attrition rate, while Research & Development had the lowest.


Attrition by Salary Band: Employees with lower salaries had significantly higher attrition rates (around 29%), indicating the importance of compensation in retention.


Years Since Last Promotion: Employees who had not been promoted in three or more years were more likely to leave, highlighting the impact of career growth opportunities.


Correlation Heatmap: This revealed positive correlations between Monthly Income and Job Level, and Years at Company, confirming relationships between salary, experience, and career progression.


Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifiers were used to predict employee attrition, with 'Attrition' (Yes/No) as the target variable.




Model Evaluation: Model performance was evaluated using Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, and SHAP Analysis.

Key Predictors of Attrition: The analysis identified several significant factors contributing to attrition:

Overtime 



Job Satisfaction (lower scores led to higher risk) 



Monthly Income (lower salaries were associated with higher attrition) 


Years Since Last Promotion 


Work-Life Balance 


Recommendations: Based on the findings, the project recommends reducing overtime, improving compensation, promoting career growth, and regularly monitoring trends using dashboards to proactively address employee disengagement.


Tools and Methodologies: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SHAP) was used for data analysis, visualization, and model building, and Power BI was used for interactive visual dashboards. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Correlation Heatmaps, Classification Models, and SHAP Analysis for feature importance were the applied methods.
